                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your password secure because
                        you’re responsible for all activity associated with your account. If you suspect someone else is
                        using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must be of legal age to use
                        ET-Learn.
                        You must provide accurate and complete information when setting up and maintaining your account.
                        You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account,
                        including any harm or damage caused by someone using your account without your permission. You
                        may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account. If you contact us
                        to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us
                        with the information we need to prove you are the owner of that account.
                        You may terminate your account at any time by following the steps detailed in our Privacy
                        Policy.

                        <strong>2. Content Enrolment and Lifetime Access</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you enroll in a course, you get a license from us to view it via the ET-Learn Services and
                        no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell content in any way. We generally grant you a
                        lifetime access license except when we must disable the content because of legal or policy
                        reasons.
                        As a student, when you enroll in a course, you are getting a license from ET-Learn to view the
                        content via our platform and Services. This license does not give you any right to resell the
                        content in any manner.
                        In legal, more complete terms, ET-Learn grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive,
                        non-transferable license to access and view the content for which you have paid all required
                        fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial educational purposes through the Services in
                        accordance with these Terms. All other uses are expressly prohibited.
                        We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course.
                        However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use any content at any point
                        in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to the content due to
                        legal or policy reasons.
                    </p>

                        <strong>3. Payments and Refunds</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. If you aren’t happy with your
                        content, ET-Learn offers a 30-day refund or credit for most content purchases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3.1 Pricing</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prices of content on ET-Learn are determined based on our pricing policies. In some
                        instances, the price of content offered on the ET-Learn website may not be exactly the same as
                        the price offered on our mobile or TV applications due to platform providers’ pricing systems
                        and their policies around implementing sales and promotions.
                        We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is
                        available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the content
                        will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3.2 Payments</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your
                        debit or credit card or process other means of payment (such as direct debit or mobile wallet)
                        for those fees. ET-Learn works with payment service providers to offer you the most convenient
                        payment methods in your country and to keep your payment information secure.
                        When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method. If
                        your payment method fails and you still get access to the content you are enrolling in, you
                        agree to pay us the corresponding fees within 30 days of notification from us. We reserve the
                        right to disable access to any content for which we have not received adequate payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>3.3 Refunds and Refund Credits</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the content you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request within 30 days of
                        your purchase that ET-Learn apply a refund to your account. We reserve the right to apply your
                        refund as a refund credit or a refund to your original payment method, at our discretion. No
                        refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed.
                        However, if the content you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you
                        are entitled to a refund beyond this 30-day limit. ET-Learn also reserves the right to refund
                        students beyond the 30-day limit in cases of suspected or confirmed account fraud.
                        To request a refund, follow the steps here. If we decide to issue refund credits to your
                        account, they will be automatically applied towards your next content purchase on our website,
                        but can’t be used for purchases in our mobile or TV applications. Refund credits may expire if
                        not used within the specified period and have no cash value in each case unless otherwise
                        required by applicable law.
                        At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, such as if you’ve consumed a
                        significant portion of the content that you want to refund, or if you’ve previously refunded the
                        content, we reserve the right to deny your refund, restrict you from other future refunds, ban
                        your account, and/or restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account or disable
                        your access to the content due to your violation of these Terms or our Trust & Safety
                        Guidelines, you will not be eligible to receive a refund.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>4. Content and Behaviour Rules</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can only use ET-Learn for lawful purposes. You’re responsible for all the content that you
                        post on our platform. You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses, and other content
                        you upload in line with our Trust & Safety Guidelines and the law and respect the intellectual
                        property rights of others. We can ban your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think
                        someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.
                        You may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful purposes. Your use of
                        the Services and behaviour on our platform must comply with applicable local or national laws or
                        regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for the knowledge of and compliance with
                        such laws and regulations that are applicable to you.
                        You cannot post any content that violates applicable local or national laws or regulations of
                        your country. You are solely responsible for any content and actions you post or take via the
                        platform and Services, and their consequences.
                        If we are put on notice that your content violates the law or the rights of others (for example,
                        if it is established that it violates intellectual property or image rights of others or is
                        about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behaviour violates our Trust &
                        Safety Guidelines, or if we believe your content or behaviour is unlawful, inappropriate, or
                        objectionable (for example, if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your content from
                        our platform. ET-Learn complies with copyright laws. Check out our Intellectual Property Policy
                        for more details.
                        ET-Learn has discretion in enforcing these Terms and our Trust & Safety Guidelines. We may
                        restrict or terminate your permission to use our platform and Services or ban your account at
                        any time, with or without notice, for any or no reason, including for any violation of these
                        Terms, if you fail to pay any fees when due, for fraudulent chargeback requests, upon the
                        request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for
                        unexpected technical issues or problems, if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal
                        activities, or for any other reason in our sole discretion. Upon any such termination, we may
                        delete your account and content, and we may prevent you from further access to the platforms and
                        use of our Services. Your content may still be available on the platforms even if your account
                        is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party
                        for termination of your account, removal of your content, or blocking of your access to our
                        platforms and services.

                        <strong>5. ET-Learn’s Rights to Content You Post</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You retain ownership of content you post to our platform. We’re allowed to share your content
                        with anyone through any media, including promoting it via advertising on other websites.
                        The content you post remains yours. By posting content, you allow ET-Learn to reuse and share
                        it, but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content.
                        When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and
                        suggestions for new features or improvements, you authorize ET-Learn to use and share this
                        content with anyone, distribute it, and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make
                        modifications or edits to it as we see fit.
                        In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us a
                        worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy,
                        reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content
                        (including your name and image) in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or
                        later developed). This includes making your content available to other companies, organizations,
                        or individuals who partner with ET-Learn for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, or
                        publication of content on other media, as well as using your content for marketing purposes. You
                        also waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature applicable to
                        all these uses to the extent permissible under applicable law. You represent and warrant that
                        you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to authorize us to use any content that
                        you submit. You also agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>6. Using ET-Learn at Your Own Risk</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyone can use ET-Learn to access educational content, and we enable users to interact with our
                        platform. Like other platforms where people can post content and interact, some things can go
                        wrong, and you use ET-Learn at your own risk.
                        Our platform model means we do not review or edit the content for legal issues, and we are not
                        in a position to determine the legality of content. We do not exercise any editorial control
                        over the content that is available on the platform, and as such, do not guarantee in any manner
                        the reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness of the content. If you access content, you
                        rely on any information provided at your own risk.
                        By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or
                        objectionable. ET-Learn has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for
                        your access or enrolment in any course or other content to the extent permissible under
                        applicable law. This also applies to any content relating to health, wellness, and physical
                        exercise. You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types
                        of content, and by accessing such content, you choose to assume those risks voluntarily,
                        including the risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full
                        responsibility for the choices you make before, during, and after your access to the content.
                        When you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that we don’t own or control.
                        We are not responsible for the content or any other aspect of these third-party sites, including
                        their collection of information about you. You should also read their terms and conditions and
                        privacy policies.

                        <strong>7. ET-Learn’s Rights</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We own the ET-Learn platform and Services, including the website, present or future apps and
                        services, and things like our logos, API, code, and content created by our employees. You can’t

                    <p>
                        These Terms are like any other contract, and they have boring but important legal terms that
                        protect us from the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal relationship
                        between us and you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>8.1 Binding Agreement</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You agree that by registering, accessing, or using our Services, you are agreeing to enter into
                        a legally binding contract with Element Tree. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not
                        register, access, or otherwise use any of our Services.
                        Any version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience, and you
                        understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.
                        These Terms (including any agreements and policies linked from these Terms) constitute the
                        entire agreement between you and us.
                        If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then that
                        provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches
                        the intent of the original provision, and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect.
                        Even if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a right in one case, it
                        doesn’t mean we waive our rights under these Terms, and we may decide to enforce them in the
                        future. If we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean we
                        waive our rights generally or in the future.
                        The following sections shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: Sections 2
                        (Content Enrolment and Lifetime Access), 5 (ET-Learn’s Rights to Content You Post), 6 (Using
                        ET-Learn at Your Own Risk), 7 (ET-Learn’s Rights), 8.5 (Subscription Disclaimers), 9
                        (Miscellaneous Legal Terms), and 10 (Dispute Resolution).
                    </p>

                        <strong>8.2 Disclaimers</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It may happen that our platform is down either for planned maintenance or because something goes
                        down with the site. It may happen that we encounter security issues. These are just examples.
                        You accept that you will not have any recourse against us in any of these types of cases where
                        things don’t work out right. In legal, more complete language, the Services and their content
                        are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We (and our affiliates, suppliers,
                        partners, and agents) make no representations or warranties about the suitability, reliability,
                        availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or accuracy of the Services or their
                        content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or conditions (express or implied), including
                        implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and
                        non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no warranty that
                        you will obtain specific results from the use of the Services. Your use of the Services
                        (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the
                        exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.
                        We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any time and for any
                        reason. Under no circumstances will ET-Learn or its affiliates, suppliers, partners, or agents
                        be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability of such
                        features.
                        We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused by
                        events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural
                        disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.
                    </p>

                        <strong>8.3 Limitation of Liability</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are risks inherent to using our Services, for example, if you access health and wellness
                        content like yoga and you injure yourself. You fully accept these risks and you agree that you
                        will have no recourse to seek damages against us even if you suffer loss or damage from using
                        our platform and Services. In legal, more complete language, to the extent permitted by law, we
                        (and our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any indirect,
                        incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or
                        business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether arising in contract, warranty,
                        tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of
                        damages in advance. Our liability (and the liability of each of our group companies, suppliers,
                        partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any circumstance is limited to the
                        greater of $100 USD or the amount you have paid us in the 12 months before the event giving rise
                        to your claims. Some jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
                        consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.
                    </p>

                        <strong>8.4 Indemnification</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you behave in a way that gets us in legal trouble, we may exercise legal recourse against
                        you. You agree to indemnify, defend (if we so request), and hold harmless ET-Learn, our group
                        companies, and their officers, directors, suppliers, partners, and agents from and against any
                        third-party claims, demands, losses, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees)
                        arising from: (a) the content you post or submit; (b) your use of the Services; (c) your
                        violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation of any rights of a third party. Your
                        indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the
                        Services.

                        <strong>8.5 Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When these Terms mention “ET-Learn,” they’re referring to the ET-Learn entity that you’re
                        contracting with. If you’re a student, your contracting entity and governing law will generally
                        be determined based on your location.
                        If you’re a student located in India, you’re contracting with Element Tree LLP, and these Terms
                        are governed by the laws of India without reference to its choice or conflicts of law
                        principles, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Mumbai,
                        India.
                        If you’re a student located in a geographical region other than India, if you’re accessing our
                        Services through one of our mobile applications and payment is processed through a mobile
                        platform provider’s payment system, or if you’re accessing our Services from outside India,
                        you’re contracting with Element Tree LLP, and these Terms are governed by the laws of India
                        without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles. In cases where the “Dispute
                        Resolution” section below doesn’t apply to you, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and
                        venue of the courts in Mumbai, India.

                        No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by
                        either party more than one year after the cause of action has accrued, except where this
                        limitation cannot be imposed by law.
                        Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by

                        You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, contractor, or agency

                        You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them). For
                        example, if you registered an account as an employee of a company, your account cannot be
                        transferred to another employee. We may assign these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted
                        under them) to another company or person without restriction. Nothing in these Terms confers any
                        right, benefit, or remedy on any third-party person or entity. You agree that your account is
                        non-transferable and that all rights to your account and other rights under these Terms
                        terminate upon your death.

                    <p>
                        You warrant that you (as an individual or as a representative of any entity on whose behalf you
                        use the Services) aren’t located in or a resident of any country that is subject to applicable
                        trade sanctions or embargoes (such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, or the Crimea,
                        Donetsk, or Luhansk regions). You also warrant that you aren’t a person or entity who is named
                        on any government specially designated national or denied-party list.
                        If you become subject to such a restriction during the term of any agreement with ET-Learn, you
                        will notify us within 24 hours, and we will have the right to terminate any further obligations
                        to you effective immediately and with no further liability to you (but without prejudice to your
                        outstanding obligations to ET-Learn).
                        You may not access, use, export, re-export, divert, transfer, or disclose any portion of the
                        Services or any related technical information or materials directly or indirectly in violation
                        of any applicable export control and trade sanctions laws, rules, and regulations. You agree not
                        to upload any content or technology (including information on encryption) whose export is
                        specifically controlled under such laws.

                        If there’s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue. If that doesn’t work,
                        your options are to go to small claims court or bring a claim in binding individual arbitration;
                        you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action
                        claim against us.
                        This Dispute Resolution section ("Dispute Resolution Agreement") applies only if you live in the
                        United States or Canada. Most disputes can be resolved, so before bringing a formal legal case,
                        please first try contacting our Support Team.

                    <p>
                        ET-Learn is committed to using its best efforts to resolve disputes with its users without the
                        need for a formal legal claim to be filed. If an issue arises between us, you and ET-Learn agree
                        to first work diligently and in good faith to reach a resolution that’s fair and equitable to
                        both sides using the mandatory informal dispute resolution process described below. On occasion,
                        a third party may be necessary to help resolve our dispute. This Dispute Resolution Agreement
                        limits how these disputes can be resolved.
                        YOU AND ET-LEARN AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, OR CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF OR
                        RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE APPLICABILITY, BREACH, TERMINATION, VALIDITY, ENFORCEMENT, OR
                        INTERPRETATION OF THEM, OR TO THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR COMMUNICATIONS WITH ET-LEARN
                        (COLLECTIVELY “DISPUTES”) THAT ARE NOT RESOLVED INFORMALLY MUST BE ADDRESSED SOLELY IN SMALL
                        CLAIMS COURT OR BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL
                        AND TO FILE A CASE IN ANY OTHER COURT.
                        YOU AND ET-LEARN FURTHER AGREE TO BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY
                        AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN
                        COURT OR IN ARBITRATION.
                        You and ET-Learn agree that this Dispute Resolution Agreement applies to each of us, as well as
                        all of our respective agents, attorneys, contractors, subcontractors, service providers,
                        employees, and all others acting for or on behalf of you and ET-Learn. This Dispute Resolution
                        Agreement is binding on your and ET-Learn’s respective heirs, successors, and assigns and is
                        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>9.2 Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before filing a claim against each other, you and ET-Learn must first participate in the
                        informal dispute resolution process described in this section.
                        The claiming party shall send to the other a short written statement (“Claim Statement”) with
                        their full name, mailing address, and email address, explaining: (a) the nature and details of
                        the Dispute; and (b) a proposal for resolving it (including any money being claimed and how that
                        amount was calculated). Sending a Claim Statement tolls the running of any applicable statute of
                        limitations for a 60-day period beginning on the date the Claim Statement is received. You
                        should send your Claim Statement to ET-Learn by email to notices@et-learn.com, and you can also
                        send it by certified mail to Element Tree, Attn: Legal, [Your Address]. ET-Learn will send Claim
                        Statements and respond to you at the email address associated with your ET-Learn account unless
                        you request otherwise.
                        When either of us receives a Claim Statement, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve
                        it informally. If we’re unable to resolve it within 60 days from receipt, then we each have the
                        right to initiate a formal claim against the other in small claims court or individual
                        arbitration, subject to the terms of this Dispute Resolution Agreement.
                        Failure to complete this process is a material breach of the Terms, and no court or arbitrator
                        shall have jurisdiction to hear or resolve any Disputes between you and ET-Learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>9.3 Small Claims</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disputes raised but not resolved through the mandatory informal dispute resolution process can
                        be brought in small claims court in: (a) Mumbai, India; (b) the county where you live; or (c)
                        another place we both agree on. We each waive the right to bring any Disputes between us in
                        courts other than small claims court, including courts of general or special jurisdiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>9.4 Arbitration</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the sole alternative to small claims court, you and ET-Learn have the right to resolve
                        Disputes through individual arbitration. While there’s no judge or jury in an arbitration, the
                        arbitrator has the power to award the same individual relief and must follow our agreement in
                        the same way as a court. If one of us brings a Dispute to a court other than a small claims
                        court, the other party can ask a court to require us both to go to arbitration. Either of us can
                        also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing. To the
                        extent that any cause of action or claim for relief can’t be addressed in arbitration, you and
                        ET-Learn agree that all court proceedings shall be paused pending the resolution in arbitration
                        of all arbitrable causes of action and claims for relief. Nothing in this Dispute Resolution
                        Agreement is intended to limit the individual relief available to either of us in arbitration or
                        small claims court.
                        If you and ET-Learn disagree on whether a Dispute must be arbitrated, the scope of the
                        arbitrator’s powers, or the enforceability of any aspect of this Dispute Resolution Agreement,
                        the arbitrator alone shall have to the fullest extent permitted by law the sole authority to
                        address all such disagreements, including but not limited to those concerning or related to the
                        formation, legality, interpretation, and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Agreement.
                        This provision doesn’t limit the procedure for challenging an improperly commenced arbitration.
                        Any court of competent jurisdiction will have the authority to enforce the requirements of this
                        Dispute Resolution Agreement and, if necessary, enjoin the filing or prosecution of any
                        arbitrations and the assessment of fees for any arbitration or mediation not conducted under
                        this Dispute Resolution Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>9.5 Fees and Costs</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You and ET-Learn agree that each party will bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees in the event
                        of a dispute, provided, however, that either party may recover fees and costs to the extent
                        permitted by applicable law. If a court or an arbitrator determines that an arbitration has been
                        brought or threatened in bad faith or that the demand was frivolous or asserted for an improper
                        purpose, the court or arbitrator may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, award attorneys’
                        fees to the party defending against the claim just as a court could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>9.6 No Class Actions</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Except as expressly provided for in connection with the Mass Arbitration Rules, we both agree
                        that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a)
                        neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated
                        action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can’t combine multiple people’s claims into
                        a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an
                        arbitrator’s decision or award in one claimant’s case can only decide the disputes of that user,
                        not other users. Nothing in this Dispute Resolution Agreement limits the parties’ rights to
                        resolve a Dispute by mutual agreement through a class-wide settlement of claims.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding the “Updating these Terms” section below, if ET-Learn changes this "Dispute
                        Resolution" section after the date you last indicated acceptance to these Terms, you may reject
                        any such change by providing ET-Learn written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery
                        to Element Tree, Attn: Legal, [Your Address], or by email from the email address associated with
                        your ET-Learn account to notices@et-learn.com within 30 days of the date such change became
                        effective as indicated by the "last updated on" language above. To be effective, the notice must
                        include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this "Dispute
                        Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute
                        between you and ET-Learn in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section
                        as of the date you last indicated acceptance to these Terms.
                    </p>

                        <strong>9.8 Improperly Commenced Arbitration</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If either party believes that the other has initiated an arbitration in violation of this
                        Dispute Resolution Agreement, if such an arbitration is threatened, or if either party has
                        reason to believe an improperly commenced arbitration is imminent, the party against whom the
                        arbitration has been or will be initiated may seek an order from a court of competent
                        jurisdiction enjoining the arbitration from being filed or continued and awarding its fees and
                        costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with seeking the order.
                    </p>

                        <strong>10. Updating These Terms</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From time to time, we may update these Terms to clarify our practices or to reflect new or
                        different practices (such as when we add new features), and ET-Learn reserves the right, in its
                        sole discretion, to modify and/or make changes to these Terms at any time. If we make any
                        material change, we will notify you using prominent means, such as by email notice sent to the
                        email address specified in your account or by posting a notice through our Services.
                        Modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.
                        Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective shall mean that you accept
                        those changes. Any revised Terms shall supersede all previous Terms.
